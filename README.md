# 🌀 Bandshell Pavilion — Computational design for a 3D-printed shell structure

## 📘 Project Overview

The **Bandshell** is a pavilion proposal exploring a new typology for outdoor acoustic structures using **3D-printed natural fibers**. Designed for both acoustic performance and sustainable construction, the project integrates **short fibers** for compression and **long fibers** for tension reinforcement, forming a structurally responsive shell system.

The geometry is inspired by the human ear, optimized to direct sound toward an audience. A protective polycarbonate skin encapsulates the structure to shield the biodegradable fibers from weather exposure.

## 🔧 Computational Contributions

This repository focuses on the **computational discretisation and edge planarization workflow**, specifically:

- 🧩 **Discretization**: Dividing the shell surface into fabricable components based on stress-line analysis, fabrication limits (1m x 1m x 1.2m), and fiber orientation.
- 📐 **Planarization**: Applying custom algorithms (including an agent-based model) to ensure panel edges are planar and compatible with long fiber reinforcement and fabrication constraints.

> My role focused on developing these workflows in Grasshopper, using Python scripting for discretization and ABM-based approaches for planarization.
